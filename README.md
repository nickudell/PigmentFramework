PigmentFramework
================

The framework for the pigment engine - beginner DX11 3D work.

This is a compilation of classes which will eventually form the framework for a DirectX11 space sim - Pigment.

At least some of this code should be reusable for other people who hope to use Direct3D 11, but I acknowledge now that not all of it is generic (yet). Such refactoring is priority 2 after actually writing the project.
